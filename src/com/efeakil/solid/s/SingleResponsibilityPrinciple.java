		The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class
		should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class
		should have only one responsibility or job. This principle helps
		to make code more maintainable and easier to understand by ensuring
		that each class has a specific, well-defined purpose.
		
		In this example, the Employee class has only one responsibility:
		to store and provide access to employee data (name and role).
		The EmployeePrinter class, on the other hand, has a single responsibility:
		to print employee data to the console. This separation of responsibilities
		makes it easier to understand and maintain the code.
