 * 			The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level
 *         modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should
 *         depend on abstractions.
 * 
 *         In this example, the Car class depends on an abstraction (the Engine
 *         interface) rather than a concrete implementation (ElectricEngine or
 *         GasEngine). This allows the implementation of the Engine to be easily
 *         swapped out without affecting the Car class, adhering to the
 *         Dependency Inversion Principle.
